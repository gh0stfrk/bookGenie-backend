                "description": "If you want to be muscular, lean, and strong as quickly as possible without steroids, good genetics, or wasting ridiculous amounts of time in the gym and money on supplements...then you want to read this book. Here's the deal: Getting into awesome shape isn't nearly as complicated as the fitness industry wants you to believe. You don't need to spend hundreds of dollars per month on the worthless supplements that steroid freaks shill in advertisements. You don't need to constantly change up your exercise routines to \"confuse\" your muscles. I'm pretty sure muscles lack cognitive abilities, but this approach is a good way to just confuse you instead. You don't need to burn through buckets of protein powder every month, stuffing down enough protein each day to feed a third world village. You don't need to toil away in the gym for a couple of hours per day, doing tons of sets, supersets, drop sets, giant sets, etc. (As a matter of fact, this is a great way to stunt gains and get nowhere.) You don't need to grind out hours and hours of boring cardio to shed ugly belly fat and love handles and get a shredded six-pack. (How many flabby treadmillers have you come across over the years?) You don't need to completely abstain from \"cheat\" foods while getting down to single-digit body fat percentages. If you plan cheat meals correctly, you can actually speed your metabolism up and accelerate fat loss. In this book you're going to learn something most guys will never know: The exact formula of exercise and eating that makes putting on 10 to 15 pounds of quality lean mass a breeze...and it only takes 8-12 weeks. This book reveals secrets like... The 6 biggest myths and mistakes of building muscle that stunt 99% of guys' muscle gains. (These BS lies are pushed by all the big magazines and even by many trainers.) How to get a lean, cut physique that you love (and that girls drool over) by spending no more than 5 percent of your time each day. The 4 laws of muscle growth that, when applied, turn your body into an anabolic, muscle-building machine. You'll be shocked at how easy it really is to get big once you know what you're doing... How to develop a lightning-fast metabolism that burns up fat quickly and leaves you feeling full of energy all day long. The carefully-selected exercises that deliver MAXIMUM results for your efforts, helping you build a big, full chest, a wide, tapered back, and bulging biceps. A no-BS guide to supplements that will save you hundreds if not THOUSANDS of dollars each year that you would've wasted on products that are nothing more than bunk science and marketing hype. How to get shredded while still indulging in the \"cheat\" foods that you love every week like pasta, pizza, and ice cream. And a whole lot more! The bottom line is you CAN achieve that \"Hollywood hunk\" body without having your life revolve around it--no long hours in the gym, no starving yourself, no grueling cardio that turns your stomach. Imagine, just 12 weeks from now, being constantly complimented on how you look and asked what the heck you're doing to make such startling gains. Imagine enjoying the added benefits of high energy levels, no aches and pains, better spirits, and knowing that you're getting healthier every day. SPECIAL BONUS FOR READERS! With this book you'll also get a free 75-page bonus report from the author called \"The Year One Challenge.\" In this bonus report, you'll learn exactly how to train, eat, and supplement to make maximum gains in your first year of training. By applying what you learn in the book and in this report, you can make more progress in one year than most guys make in three, four, or even five (seriously!). Scroll up, click the \"Buy\" button now, and begin your journey to a bigger, leaner, and stronger you!",
